# Triangles
TRIANGLES: — Blockchain-Powered Transparent Healthcare Network

Today, public healthcare systems face two huge issues:
1.	Supply Chain Corruption: Medicines and medical equipment meant for hospitals often disappear, get delayed, or are counterfeited — harming patients and wasting public funds.
2.	Lack of Trusted Medical Records & Doctor Verification:
Patients have no ownership of their health records.
It’s hard to verify doctor credentials — many areas face quacks and unverified consultants.
2️⃣ Solution:
Triangles is a decentralized platform that uses blockchain to bring full transparency to public healthcare:
✅ Supply Chain Transparency:

           •	Track medical supplies from supplier → warehouse → hospital → patient
           •	Immutable delivery records prevent corruption
           •	Public and government can audit deliveries anytime
✅ Decentralized Health Records:	
•	Patients control their own records — stored off-chain (IPFS) with on-chain proof
•	Records linked to wallet, portable across providers
✅ Verified Doctor Directory:
•	Doctors are verified and issued on-chain credentials
•	Patients can search doctors, see consultation history, and trust verified profiles

3️⃣ Why Blockchain?
•	Immutability:                 Supply delivery cannot be faked
•	Transparency:                 Anyone can audit — increases trust in public systems
•	Ownership:                    Patients own their records, not corporations
•	Verification:                 Doctor credentials cannot be forged

4️⃣ Target Users:

    •	Government Health Departments — fight supply chain corruption
    •	Public Health NGOs — ensure transparency
    •	Patients — own their records and trust their doctors
    •	Doctors — build verifiable public profiles
________________________________________
5️⃣ Impact:
•	Reduce medicine leakage 
•	Save crores in public health budgets
•	Build public trust in government healthcare
•	Empower patients with control over their data
•	Make fake doctors easy to detect and prevent

6️⃣ Demo:
✅ Government admins can track supplies
✅ Supplier mints batch, updates delivery — public and government can track
✅ Hospital confirms delivery — verified on blockchain
✅ Patient profile shows health records — wallet-controlled
✅ Verified doctor directory — on-chain credentials + consultation history

7️⃣ Why it can scale:
•	No new hardware — uses existing devices + QR codes
•	Works with Polygon Amoy chain — low gas fees
•	Government can adopt this as part of public health digital stack
•	Easy to extend to insurance, DAOs, AI-driven analytics
________________________________________
8️⃣ Tech Stack:
•	Blockchain: Solidity + Polygon Amoy
•	Frontend:  Next.js + Ethers.js
•	Storage: IPFS for records + NFTs for credentials + Database (Firebase or MongoDb)
•	Smart Contracts (deployed before offline round to prevent wasting hours on this)
